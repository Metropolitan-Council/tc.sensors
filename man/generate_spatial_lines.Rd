Generate spatial lines dataset from sensor configuration
}
\details{
\subsection{Important considerations}{

Lines are generated based on the detector's corridor route, direction, and category,
defined specifically for I-35 and T.H.5 north and south of the cities,
and east and west of the cities. When run with the
full configuration dataset, it can result in some lines over 200 miles
long and passing over areas where the road does not exist. Rather than
running the entire configuration, identify specific corridors and sensors
and narrow the configuration dataset to just those sensors.

If your goal is to map the entire road network, consider using one of the
datasets available from MnDOT or the Metropolitan Council on
\href{https://gisdata.mn.gov/}{Minnesota Geospatial Commons}.
