## Overview
A package for pulling data for Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) loop detectors installed on the Minnesota Freeway system in 30-second interval measurements of occupancy and volume, data which are pushed daily to a public JSON feed.  

## Installation  

```{r}
remotes::install_github("Metropolitan-Council/tc.sensors")
```

## Documentation

To access documentation and for help on how to use the package, run `?<FUNCTION-NAME>` (e.g. `?pull_sensor`, `?pull_configuration`, `?pull_sensor_ids`).  Access vignettes in the vignettes file to see examples of end-to-end workflows for pulling and storing data locally en masse.  Check back for a vignettes for calculating speeds, reference speeds, delay, and VMT from the resulting files.  

## Relevant definitions  

Definitions come from MnDOT Data Extract [documentation](http://data.dot.state.mn.us/datatools/dataextract.html)

- **Volume** The number of vehicles that pass through a detector in a given time period.  
- **Occupancy** The percentage of time a detector's field is occupied by a vehicle.  
- **Flow** The number of vehicles that pass through a detector per hour (`Volume * Samples per Hour`).  
- **Headway**  The number of seconds between each vehicle (`Seconds_per_Hour / Flow`).  
- **Density** The number of vehicles per mile (`Flow / Speed`). See [full calculation method](http://data.dot.state.mn.us/datatools/Density.html) for additional context.  
- **Speed** The average speed of the vehicles that pass in a sampling period (`Flow / Density`).  
- **Lost/Spare Capacity** The average flow that a roadway is losing, either due to low traffic or high congestion, throughout the sampling period.  
  - `Flow > 1800: 0`
  - `Density > 43: Lost Capacity: Flow - 1800`
  - `Density >= 43: Lost Capacity: 1800 - Flow`

## Associated repositories and projects
