  abstract = {In general, congestion happens when the demand for a roadway is higher than its available capacity at
a given point in time. Traffic congestion may be one byproduct of a thriving economy where people and
goods are traveling throughout the region at certain times during the day. However, there are also a
wide variety of negative impacts of congestion.
These negative effects will only grow as the Twin Cities metropolitan area is expected to add about
500,000 more people from 2020 to 2040.1 Without a significant change in travel behavior, this
population increase will result in more people traveling, and consequently more congestion. Both the
Metropolitan Council and MnDOT long-range plans emphasize that eliminating congestion is not
possible or feasible, especially in a rapidly growing metropolitan area. However, understanding the
impacts of congestion is an important first step when determining what level of congestion is acceptable
and what funding is needed to mitigate some of the negative impacts of congestion.},

  abstract = {It would be easy to assume that Twin Cities' highway congestion is solely a Twin Cities problem.
However, congestion in the Twin Cities greatly impacts people and businesses across the state. This
white paper identifies why making investments in Twin Cities' highways is an issue of statewide
importance.
In the Minnesota Statewide Highway Investment Plan 2018-2037 (MnSHIP), the Minnesota Department
of Transportation (MnDOT) directs capital resources for the next 20 years into 14 different investment
categories. One of these investment categories is ``Twin Cities Mobility'' and includes, but is not limited
to, investments in MnPASS lanes, new interchanges, and additional highway lanes. Funding in this
MnSHIP investment category is directed to the MnDOT Metro District, which includes the eight counties
surrounding Minneapolis and Saint Paul, where congestion and delay issues are the worst in the state.1
The negative effects of Twin Cities congestion, however, impact residents and businesses across the
entire state.},

  author = {Shawn Turner and Tongbin Qu},
  year = {2013},
  month = {may},
  institution = {{Texas A\&M Transportation Institute}},
  abstract = {The overall goal of this study was to use commercially-available travel speed data to develop arterial street
mobility performance measures in the eight-county Twin Cities Metropolitan Area. The research team licensed
2011 historical traffic speed data from INRIX for 1,604 directional-miles of arterial streets, and conflated this
speed data with MnDOT traffic volume data on the same street network. Based on prevailing practice, TTI
recommended travel speed-based mobility performance measures that compare peak traffic speeds to speeds during
light daytime traffic. However, it was recognized that light daytime traffic speeds are not necessarily the goal or
target for the performance measures, but simply a convenient and easily-measured reference point. Instead,
performance measure target values should be context-sensitive and based upon surrounding land use. Multiple
measures should be used to quantify and monitor mobility on arterial streets, including delay per mile, travel time
index, and the planning time index (a measure of reliability). The exact mobility performance measures and target
values are likely to evolve and be refined as MnDOT and partner agencies gain experience in performance
monitoring on arterial streets. At this time, TTI recommends calculating, tracking, and gaining experience with
multiple measures, while also determining where these measures can be used to improve agency decisions.},

  abstract = {The Greater Cairo Metropolitan Area (GCMA), with more than 19 million inhabitants, is host to more than one-fifth of Egypt's population. The GCMA is also an important contributor to the Egyptian economy in terms of GDP and jobs. The population of the GCMA is expected to further increase to 24 million by 2027, and correspondingly its importance to the economy will also increase. Traffic congestion is a serious problem in the GCMA with large and adverse effects on both the quality of life and the economy. In addition to the time wasted standing still in traffic, time that could be put to more productive uses, congestion results in unnecessary fuel consumption, causes additional wear and tear on vehicles, increases harmful emissions lowering air quality, increases the costs of transport for business, and makes the GCMA an unattractive location for businesses and industry. These adverse effects have very real and large monetary and nonmonetary costs not only for the economy of the GCMA, but given its size, for the economy of Egypt as well. As the population of the GCMA continues to increase, traffic congestion is becoming worse and the need to address this congestion is becoming more urgent. In recognition of the seriousness of the problem of traffic congestion, and upon the request of Government, primarily the Ministries of Finance, Transport, Housing, and Interior, the World Bank funded an investigation into its magnitude, causes, and potential solutions in the GCMA. This report documents the results of the study. The results of this study should be of interest to policy-makers and practitioners in the GCMA, the Egyptian Government, other cities facing similar problems, and international financial institutions.},
