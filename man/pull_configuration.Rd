\title{Pull metro sensor configuration}
\usage{
pull_configuration(return_opt = "in_memory", .quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{return_opt}{character, indicate how to return the data.
\code{"within_dir"} will return the data within the directory as a csv entitled
"Configuration of Metro Detectors YYYY-MM-DD".
\code{"in-memory"} will return the data in R, but requires assignment.}

\item{.quiet}{boolean, whether to hide messages. Default is TRUE}
}
\value{
dataframe containing 20 variables, including detector_field and lat/lons,
for each sensor in MnDOT's metro district
\itemize{
\item \code{detector_name} character, the detector's unique identifier in numbers
\item \code{detector_label} character, the detector's label including abbreviations of the roads associated with the roadway node.
\item \code{detector_category} character, the detector lane type in code. \href{https://github.com/mnit-rtmc/iris/blob/5b3dcbbcd6d177b2a1d37576bdd06b7d33a6facd/src/us/mn/state/dot/tms/LaneType.java}{Source}
\itemize{
\item "" Mainline
\item "A" Auxiliary, mainline auxiliary (ends within a mile)
\item "B" Bypass, ramp meter bypass
\item "CD" Collector/Distributor
\item "D" Shoulder, mainline shoulder
\item "G" Green, ramp meter displayed green count
\item "H" High-Occupancy Vehicle
\item "HT" High-Occupancy Vehicle or Toll
\item "M" Merge, Freeway on-ramp (counts all merging traffic)
\item "O" Omnibus, bus only
\item "P" Passage, ramp meter passage
\item "PK" Parking, parking space presence detector
\item "Q" Queue, ramp metering queue
\item "R" Reversible mainline
\item "V" Velocity, mainline speed loop
\item "X" Exit, freeway exit ramp
}
\item \code{detector_lane} character, the detector's lane. Lanes are numbered from right-to-left, starting with the right lane as 1.
\item \code{detector_field} character, the detector's field length in feet
\item \code{detector_abandoned} character, whether the detector is no longer in use.
\item \code{r_node_name} character, abbreviated roadway node name.
\item \code{r_node_n_type} character, one of "Station", "Exit", "Entrance", or "Intersection"
\item \code{r_node_transition} character, how the entrance or exit nodes connect with linked nodes
\item \code{r_node_label} character, unique road name, including affixes such as “St” or “Rd” or stall number
\item \code{r_node_lon} character, the roadway node longitude
\item \code{r_node_lat} character, the roadway node latitude
\item \code{r_node_lanes} character, for an entrance or exit ramp, this is the number of lanes entering or exiting the corridor. Otherwise, it is the number of lanes on the corridor.
\item \code{r_node_shift} character,  the difference (number of lanes) between the corridor reference lane and the attach side of the roadway node.
\item \code{r_node_s_limit} character, the posted speed limit in miles per hour
\item \code{r_node_station_id} character, A unique identifier for the detectors associated with a station roadway node
\item \code{r_node_attach_side} character, whether the r_node is attached to the left side of the road. This can be used to create left entrance or exit ramps.
\item \code{corridor_route} character, the corridor route name. All roadway nodes with the same road and direction-of-travel are grouped into corridors.
\item \code{corridor_dir} character, the corridor route direction. One of "EB", "NB", "SB", or "WB"
\item \code{date}date, the date the configuration was accessed

\description{
Read MnDOT JSON feed and wrangle into a tidy dataframe containing 20 variables related to sensor configuration.
Useful for mapping (contains lat/lons) and calculating performance measures (contains detector_field).
